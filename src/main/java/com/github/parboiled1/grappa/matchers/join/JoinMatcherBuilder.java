/**
 * The final step to building a {@link JoinMatcher}
 *
 * <p>At this step of the build, we have both rules (the "joined" rule and the
 * "joining" rule). The final information to feed to the matcher is the number
 * of cycles.</p>
 *
 * <p>The number of cycles can be bounded on the lower end and on the upper end.
 * The "true" building method is {@link #range(Range)}; all other methods
 * ultimately call this one to generate the result.</p>
 *
 * <p>The real matcher generated depends on the number of cycles required (for
 * the notation used here, see the javadoc for {@link Range}):</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>[0..0]: an {@link EmptyMatcher};</li>
 *     <li>[0..1]: an {@link OptionalMatcher} with the joined rule as a
 *     submatcher;</li>
 *     <li>[1..1]: the "joined" rule itself;</li>
 *     <li>[n..+âˆž) for whatever n: a {@link BoundedDownJoinMatcher};</li>
 *     <li>[0..n] for n &gt;= 2: a {@link BoundedUpJoinMatcher};</li>
 *     <li>[n..n] for n &gt;= 2: an {@link ExactMatchesJoinMatcher};</li>
 *     <li>[n..m]: a {@link BoundedBothJoinMatcher}.</li>
